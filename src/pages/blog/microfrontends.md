New age Microservice design pattern, for front-end application to decompose a monolithic application into individual semi-independent micro-apps with simple single responsibility, audience-driven, easy to develop and maintain with iterative approach, enable many benefits such as independent deployments, migration and experimentation, and resilient applications.

Micro Frontend are not trying to replace component architecture rather its a technique that decouple between teams and decentralize responsibility of each feature/capability & controlled separately independent of other team members that are more manageable and independent lifecycle and even stack.

# Decomposed & Iterative approach

With decomposition, decentralizing decisions to teams, a value-addition for organization and platforms as team lives and breathe with the product-teams and SME business experts without boundaries and constraints that sometimes are unnecessary.

Micro Frontend is change-in-game, Iterative approach for plan, design and deliverables and technology-independent and allow-s team to deploy pilot solutions and technologies for defined users and parallel implementation on upcoming features and roadmap as teams scope are changed to small rather than full single application.



> Techniques, strategies and recipes for building a modern web app with multiple teams using different JavaScript frameworks. — Micro Frontends


# Things to consider —

Compatibility of UI Frameworks & versions support
Data & State Management
When-to-use guidelines, as it adds flexibility + complexity to platform

# Advantages -

Scalable solution
Independent Development and Deployment — Cross-Team approach, Faster & Independent Team Development
Flexibility — Micro frontend architecture & design principles integrated existing web frameworks
Technology Agnostic — Rendering library agnostic (integrates with React, Vue etc.)
More comfortable Framework
Modular architecture with Apps
Progressive and easy to adopt in existing applications — Incremental Upgrade
Isolated Runtime — State is isolated between each child/sub-application and no shared runtime state.

# Disadvantages -

Testing & Deployment challenges for ensuring all units are in-force, includes the all capabilities without failures or break points

# Frameworks available —
